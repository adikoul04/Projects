# Projects
My name is Aditya Koul. I am a CS student at the University of Maryland. I am interested in the fields of software development, AI/ML, robotics, and autonomous systems. This is where I will post personal projects. Feel free to comment and offer advice as I am always trying to improve my skills. Have fun browsing!
